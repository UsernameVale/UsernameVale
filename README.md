- 💃🏻 Heey, I’m @UsernameVale, welcome to my very serious and professional read me!!
- 🤔 I’m interested in various topics: philosophy, science, tech, psychology, economy, music, art, culture, languages, politics, fashion, gaming, movies and TV-shows as well as writing.
- 👩🏻‍🎓 I’m currently learning... something I hope? Python, SQL and the use of tools such as Docker. Mandarin and how to read notes on duolingo. lmao
- 💅🏻 I’m looking to collaborate on cool things!! Anybody got some cool stuff going on?? Anyone!?!? ...Hello?! I'm desperately looking for some friends...
- 🧌 How to reach me: If you don't necessarily have to, you'd probably prefere not to.
- 🪩 Fun fact: I barely can take anything serious, I'm trying my best through... Hope y'all ain't mad... as(s) me.🤪 xDD
